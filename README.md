## Contributing


- Fork the project:
 Click the gray Fork button at the top right of this page. This creates your copy of the project and saves it as a new repository in your GitHub account

- Click on the green Code button, then either the HTTPS or SSH option, and, click the icon to copy the URL. Now you have a copy of the project. Thus, you can play around with it locally on your computer.

- Run the following commands into a terminal window (Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, Bash, ZSH). Do this to download the forked copy of this repository to your computer.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DIEMS-HUB/Get-Started.git
```

- Switch to the cloned folder. You can paste this command into the same terminal window.

```bash
  cd Get-Started
```

- Make a new branch. Your username would make a good branch because it's unique.

```bash
  git checkout -b <name-of-new-branch>
```

- Open the `README.md` file

- **Add your name to the section that matches your Initial in this list, make sure that your name is in alphabetical order. Then save your changes.**

- For example
  `- [Aditya Simant](https://github.com/adityasimant)`

- Stage your changes.

```bash
  git add README.md
```

or

```bash
  git add .
```

- Commit the changes.

```bash
  git commit -m "Add <your-github-username>"
```


- Pushing your repository to GitHub.

```bash
  git push origin <name-of-your-branch>
```

or

```bash
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
```


- On the GitHub website, navigate to your forked repo - on the top of the files section, you'll notice a new section containing a `Compare & Pull Request` button!

- Click on that button, this will load a new page, comparing the local branch in your forked repository against the main branch in the DIEMS Hub Get-Started. Accept the default values in the dropdown boxes and click the green `Create Pull Request` button. After creating the PR (Pull Request), our GitHub Actions workflow will add a welcome message to your PR.
  Note: A pull request allows us to merge your changes with the original project repo.

- Your pull request will be reviewed and then eventually merged.
